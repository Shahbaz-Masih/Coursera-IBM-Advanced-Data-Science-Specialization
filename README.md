In this project, plant power output of a combined cycle power plant was predicted by using linear regression, decision tree and random forest regressors and neural networks. Firstly, the business problem and use case were identified. Then, required data to solve the business problem was specified. The data was extracted from the identified source and prepared for analysis by data wrangling. Exploratory data analysis was performed to have an idea of tackling the business problem. Feature engineering was done based on exploratory data analysis and further correlation recognition. Lastly, Machine learning, hyperparameter tuning and deep learning were used to build and optimize models to solve business problem i.e. coming up with a correlation to estimate plant power output based on ambient conditions data. This report has been generated as the main deliverable for this business problem that also contains the correlation.
